# Installation

## Requirements and Setup

Dria SDK is compatible with Python 3.10 or higher. To install the SDK, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install dria
```

## Obtaining Your RPC Key

To interact with the Dria Network, you'll need an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) token. This token is essential for sending tasks to the network.
Visit the [Dria Login API](https://dkn.dria.co/auth/generate-token) and get your unique RPC token.

## Important Notes

- **Network Status**: The Dria Network is currently in alpha stage. Access is managed through RPCs to ensure controlled access and trusted task execution.

- **Cost**: At present, there is no cost associated with generating data using Dria. However, a valid RPC token is required to access the network.

- **Contributing**: You can contribute to the Dria ecosystem by running a [node](https://dria.co/join) in the Dria network. This helps scale the network and improve throughput.

## Next Steps

Once you have your RPC token, you're ready to start using the Dria SDK. Check out the examples from cookbook (e.g. [Patient Dialogues](cookbook/patient_dialogues.md)) or see [Core Concepts](core-concepts/overview.md) to learn how to create your first synthetic data pipeline.
